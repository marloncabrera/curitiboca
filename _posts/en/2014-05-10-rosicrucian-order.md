## Rosicrucian Order

The Rosicrucian Order Great Store was implanted in 1956 in Rio de Janeiro and it was transferred to Curitiba in 1960. The temple is one of the six buildings in Egyptian style that pays homage to their first members who made meetings inside secret chambers in the Great Pyramid.
In the others buildings are found the administrative office, “H. Spencer Lewis” auditorium, a memorial with a pyramid and Curitiba's Store. The Curitiba's Store has a library and Museum with replicas of Egyptian pieces of several dynasties, including papyrus and mummies.
