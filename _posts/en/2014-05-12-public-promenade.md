## Public Promenade
 
In the past century it was denominated Botanical Garden. It was inaugurated on May 2nd 1886 by the President of Paraná Province Alfredo d’Escragnolle Taunay as the first public park in Curitiba.
This place was the first big sanitation work in the city, transforming a bog into a green leisure area with lakes, bridges and islands. The first zoo of Curitiba shelters today small animals. Its gate is a copy of the one that existed in the Dog’s Cemetery in Paris.
