## FREE UNIVERSITY OF ENVIRONMENT
 
Due to the Free University of Environment located in the middle of Zaninelli’s woods, Curitiba became the first city in the world to offer a space to study and transference of knowledge about the environment and ecology to the public. Its architectonic project reveals through rustic materials the four elements: earth, fire, water and air. Despite of the rare beauty its main goal is to bring about environmental consciousness to the citizens as a way of survival. It was created on June 5th 1991 and inaugurated by the French Oceanographer Jacques Cousteau in 1992.
