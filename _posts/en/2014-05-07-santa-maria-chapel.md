## Santa Maria Chapel

The Chapel of Santa Maria was part of the set of buildings that made up the former facilities of Santa Maria College, Counselor at the intersection of streets and Laurindo Marshal Diodorus. Before the Marist Brothers, who used the school buildings from 1924, the site was occupied by the Sisters of Charity of Sion in 1905.

The chapel was inaugurated only in 1939, in honor of Our Lady. In 1983, the college moved to its present site near the San Lorenzo Park. Some features of the neoclassical style can be seen in the historic building, as the top finish of each window in full details and moldings and pilasters formed on pairs of arc windows.

On the walls, on each set of windows there is a quadrangular frame-Notch floral arrangement inside. The finish plaster and varied polychrome give the space a sense of grandeur characteristic of religious buildings. Today, restored by the city, the chapel was transformed into a concert hall for chamber music with 278 seats and also the headquarters of the Camerata Antiqua de Curitiba.
