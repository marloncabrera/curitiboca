## 24 Hours Street

Opened in 1991, the 24 Hours Street was reopened in November 2011 and once again became a reference and meeting point for people looking for good food, gifts, reading and leisure downtown.

After the renovation, the Street displays again the architecture that made it known worldwide, with the large arches and the 24-hour clock, reopening with a varied mix of commerce and services.
