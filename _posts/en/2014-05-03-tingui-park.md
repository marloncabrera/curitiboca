## Tingui Park
 
Integrating part of the biggest environmental linear park in Brazil, at the margins of Barigüi River, it reminds the ancient native Indians, who used to live in this area, through the statue of Cacique Tindiqüera. Here is also located the Ukrainian Memorial, honoring the immigrants. It is a replica of an Orthodox Church, built in the state’s countryside, where an exhibition of pesankas and icons takes place.
