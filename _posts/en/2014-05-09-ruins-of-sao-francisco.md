## RUINS OF SÃO FRANCISCO 

Space surrounded by legends, at the João Cândido Square. The ruins are made of stone and should be the São Francisco de Paula Church, which was never finished. In 1811 the chapel and the sacristy were finished, however in 1860 the stones that would conclude the building were used to finished the tower of the ancient main church, that is nowadays the Minor Basilica Cathedral of Nossa Senhora da Luz.
Stories about tunnels and pirates marked the place, today with a space for stories and leisure, a stage and stalls, forming the “Arcades of the Ruins”.
