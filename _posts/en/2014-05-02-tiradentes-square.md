## Tiradentes Square
 
It is the main square in Curitiba and its most important feature is the Nossa Senhora da Luz Minor Basilica Cathedral that turned 100 years old in 1993.Curitiba was founded in this region on March 29th 1693. Previously known as Largo da Matriz, this square is the landmark of Curitiba. In 1880, the square’s name was changed to D. Pedro II due to the Emperor Pedro II visit to Paraná.
Nine years later when Brazil was already a republic, the square name was changed to Tiradentes Square. It is an important public bus station.and it is a common and permanent meeting point to all, bringing beloved memories to curitibanos.

The new floor at the old square reveals traces of the city from yesterday, under the glasses that reflect the branches of trees, some of them as old as the 1936 pinetree, others yollow as the ipê tre's flowers when the frosts are over. At the square the city encounters and recognizes itself.
