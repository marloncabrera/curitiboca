## São Lourenço Park

The 1970’s flood gave place to a sea of green. Implanted in 1972 this park was originated from the need to repair the damages caused by the breaking of the São Lourenço dam. An old glue and fertilizers factory was transformed into the Creativity Center of Curitiba, which offers courses, training, presentations and exhibitions.
In May, 1994 the Center founded the Lyceum of Arts in order to preserve old techniques and to train apprentices, so they have bigger chances in the job market. Here creativity flows together with the countryside peace, where sheeps are part of the landscape. Handicraft fair on Saturdays from 10am to 5 pm.
