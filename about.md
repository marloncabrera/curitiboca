*Curitiboca* is a website about the Curitiba city and a personal project to help me learn about HTML5 & CSS3.

The site is built using [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) an open source static site generator. It is hosted using [Amazon S3 site hosting with CloudFront](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/swh/website-hosting-intro.html).
